# Thesis

Data_generation contains the code for generating open population data used in Chapters 5 and 6 of my PhD thesis.

Two examples of analysis code for the mixed model analyses in Chapter 5 are also given. Ch5_Mixedmodel_analysis_discrete_basecase is an example of the code used for discrete estimands. Ch5_Mixedmodel_analysis_OC_basecase is an example of the code used for the OC estimands. Both of these apply to the basecase scenarios only. Code for the complications scenarios is available on request.

An example of analysis code for the JM, CW and HET models of Chapter 6 are also given in Ch6_JM_CW_HET_analysis.
